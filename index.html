			  <p>Born in June 10, 1962 in the northern Egyptian city of Tanta, Tawfik graduated from Tanta University's medical school in 1985. He attained a PhD in 1997. In 1992, he joined the Modern Arab Association publishing company and began writing his first series of novels the following year. In January 1993, he published the first installment in his horror/thriller series Ma Waraa Al Tabiaa (Arabic: ما وراء الطبيعة‎) which translates to Metaphysics. He also writes periodical articles for journals and web-based magazines such as El Destoor and Rewayty. His writing style has appealed to both Egyptian and broader Arabic-speaking audiences, gaining him popularity in Egypt and the Middle East.

		Tawfik's novels typically feature all Egyptian characters and are set both in Egypt and around the world. Some of his characters are semi-autobiographical. Tawfik draws from personal experiences in their creation; fans consider him their "godfather" and identify him most closely with his character, Refaat Ismael, who was featured in the Ma Waraa Al Tabiaa series. His book Utopia may even reflect Egypt as it is becoming, with rich and poor and no middle-class.</p>

			 He began writing his stories when he was ten years old and he wrote, in all, more than 500 books. His series Fantasia was the first of its kind; a plot that presents famous literary works to young people, through an interactive presentation. "Fantasia" presented the young Arab reader to a wide spectrum of topics from Arthur Conan Doyle and Sikhism, to Dostoevsky and the Cosa Nostra.[citation needed]
